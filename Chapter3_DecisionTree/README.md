# What is decision tree?
  Decision tree is a supervised machine learning method. It is used for classification and regression. It is based on a binary tree.
# Strategy
## Prepare the training data --- vectors and labels
## prepare the binary tree
### At each node, test each set of variables and threshold and calculate the improvement of figure of merit
### finalization of the tree
#### the number of nodes is large enough
#### the number of depth is large enough
#### the number of events in the final nodes is small enough
#### the improvement is small enough
### prunning to avoid the over training
